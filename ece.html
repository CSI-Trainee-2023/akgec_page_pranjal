            <p>The Electronics and Communication stream represents two fastest growing technology areas in view of <br>
                exponential growth taking place in our country. Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) involves <br>
                researching, designing, developing and testing of electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics <br>
                and Communication Engineering is also considered as the backbone of the modern communication system. In the <br>
                current scenario, modern applications like the Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, and Embedded Systems are <br>
                highly dependent on the knowledge of ECE. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualize and <br>
                oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. It has an important role from defence sector<br> 
                to space programs to the basic need of human beings including the internet to the entertainment industry. <br>
                Electronics and Communication Engineering has a wide scope as compared to other.<br>

                There are numerous opportunities to build a career after completing the engineering course in the field of <br>
                Electronics and Communication Engineering. An individual can make his/her career in IT industry, defence, <br>
                telecommunications, electronic and hardware manufacturing, embedded systems development, software <br>
                development, power sector, TV and music industry, automobiles, space communications, home appliances <br>
                development, electronic security systems, mobile phones testing and development, communication protocols <br>
                development and optical communications development among others.<br>
                
                Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at AKGEC was established in 1998. The<br> 
                department provides an outstanding research environment complemented by excellence in teaching. Ever<br> 
                since its inception, the department has been a pioneering academic centre for technical education, research<br> 
                and innovation in all major areas of Electronics and Communication Engineering.<br>
                
                The department is organized in tune with these latest developments in terms of curriculum, well-qualified<br> 
                faculty and the state-of-the-art labs for B.Tech. (UG course) in Electronics & Communication Engineering along<br> 
                with M.Tech. (PG course) in Electronics & Communication Engineering. Approved intake of B.Tech. (ECE) course <br>
                is 180 students and for the M.Tech. (ECE) course it is 18 students.<br>
                
                The department has adequate number of laboratories as per requirement (strength of students in the<br> 
                department and number of practical courses mentioned in syllabus scheme). These laboratories are fully<br> 
                equipped with latest / modern hardware kits / equipments, software tools and consumables. ECE labs have all<br> 
                the basic as well as advanced level facilities to fulfill the requirements of UG, PG and PhD level courses. <br>
                These laboratories are fully utilized by the students and faculty members of ECE department for performing <br>
                the practical experiments, doing the Project Work and Research Activities (R & D). One dedicated Lab Staff <br>
                member is always present in each laboratory room. Responsibility of each lab room also has been assigned to <br>
                a Faculty Lab Incharge to ensure regular maintenance and up-gradation of laboratories. ECE department also <br>
                has established Texas Instruments-Centre of Excellence Lab, NI-LabVIEW Academy, Virtual Lab (with IIT Kanpur) <br>
                and IoT Lab etc in collaboration with reputed industries and academic institutes.<br>
                
                The department has its technical society-Phoenix. The society organizes many technical competitions, quizzes,<br> 
                technical seminars, mock interviews, aptitude tests, project exhibition and technical paper presentation etc <br>
                for the students. ECE department also has an active IEEE-Communication Society student branch chapter for <br>
                organizing / participating various events at international level.<br>
                
                B. Tech. ECE is accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA).
