            <p>Civil Engineering is the art of directing the sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, for <br>
                improvement of quality of life. The theory and practice of Civil Engineering is basically applied in the <br>
                construction of buildings & structures, roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation ports, docks and <br>
                harbours.At AKGEC, B.Tech course in Civil Engineering is offered with intake capacity of 60.The goal of the <br>
                department is to produce high quality technical manpower needed by industry, R&D organizations and <br>
                academic institutions and above all to meet the engineering needs of the nation.The faculty comprises of <br>
                galaxies of qualified and experienced teachers with Ph.D and M Tech from premier institutions like IITs and <br>
                NITs.<br>

                The academic activities of the Department emphasize deep understanding of fundamental principles, <br>
                development of creative ability to handle the challenges of Civil Engineering and the analytical ability to solve <br>
                problems which are interdisciplinary in nature.The Department also encourages its students to engage in <br>
                extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, essential for development and nurturing of team spirit, developing <br>
